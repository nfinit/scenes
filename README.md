`scenes` is a work-in-progress online hierarchical photo album management system. This project is being developed mainly to manage travel photography, but can reasonably be applied to any other subject.

## Feature outline

`scenes` is very roughly inspired by Dave Flack's [World Photo Album](https://www.qsl.net/ah6hy/photos.html), one of my favorite travel websites for the volume of interesting content it presents in a simple, brief format. `scenes` aims to be just as simple, but also much more flexible and maintainable on the backend.
